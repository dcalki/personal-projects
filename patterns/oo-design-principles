Design Principles:
1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same. 
Take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later on you can alter or extend the parts 
that vary without affecting those that don't.

2. Program to an interface, not an implementation.

3. Favor composition over inheritance.
